# Shutdown-listener
A Java TCP socket listener for shutting down a computer

Occasionally windows likes to turn on my computer from being in hybernate. I created this to allow me to remotely turn it back off through an app on my phone I made. It also works for the occation windows keeps turning it back on by constantly hybernating until windows gives up or an abort command is receieved by the app.
